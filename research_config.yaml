topic: "Multifactorial Influences on Nervous System Repair in Autoimmune and Neurological Disorders"
description: >
  This research project aims to explore various factors influencing the repair of the nervous system and the progression of autoimmune diseases.
  It will investigate the interplay between micronutrients (such as alpha lipoic acid, vitamin D, and B vitamins),
  environmental and lifestyle factors, and pharmacological interventions on disease mechanisms and metabolic pathways.
  The study will focus on autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis,
  where distinct pathological processes cause nervous system damage, and will also consider other conditions such as long COVID
  and other autoimmune disorders that result in nervous system impairment.
